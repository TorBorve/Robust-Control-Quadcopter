# Robust Control 2D Quadcopter

Project in the course Robust Control & Convex Optimization at ETH Zurich.

Read `Robust_Control_Helicopter_Final.pdf` for more details.

## Run
The code is written in MATLAB and only verified for MATLAB 2023b, if you have another MATLAB version it might not work as expected.

To find the final controller and generate the figures seen in the final report run the following file:
```matlab
main_robust_controller();
```
